<h1>An Adventure in R: Categorial predictors (several categories)</h1>
<div id="section-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This tutorial is one of a series that accompanies <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/an-adventure-in-statistics/">An Adventure in Statistics</a> <span class="citation">(A. P. Field 2016)</span> and <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/discovering-statistics-using-r/">Discovering Statistics Using R</a> <span class="citation">(A. P. Field, Miles, and Field 2012)</span> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Field_(academic)">me</a>. These tutorials contain abridged sections from the book so there are some copyright considerations but I offer them under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License</a>,<a href="#section-fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="section-fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Who is the tutorial aimed at?
<ul>
<li>Primarily students enrolled on my <em>Linear models in statistics</em> module at the University of Sussex, but anyone teaching from or reading <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/an-adventure-in-statistics/">An Adventure in Statistics</a> or <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/discovering-statistics-using-r/">Discovering Statistics Using R</a> <span class="citation">(A. P. Field, Miles, and Field 2012)</span> may find them useful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is covered?
<ul>
<li>This tutorial looks at how to fit a linear model with a predictor variable that represents more than two independent categories. We look at robust variants of the model, and computing a Bayes factor. It would be a useful tutorial to run alongside teaching based on Chapter 16 of <a href="https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/an-adventure-in-statistics/">An Adventure in Statistics</a>.</li>
<li>This tutorial <em>does not</em> teach the background theory: it is assumed you have either attended my lecture or read the relevant chapter in the aforementioned books (or someone else’s)</li>
<li>The aim of this tutorial is to augment the theory that you already know by guiding you through fitting linear models using <strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> and asking you questions to test your knowledge along the way.</li>

<h2>Story précis</h2>
<div id="section-why-a-precis" class="section level3">
<h3>Why a précis?</h3>
<p>Because these tutorials accompany my book <em>An adventure in statistics</em>, which uses a fictional narrative to teach the statistics, some of the examples might not make sense unless you know something about the story. For those of you who don’t have the book I begin each tutorial with a précis of the story. If you’re not interested then fair enough - click past this section.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-general-context-for-the-story" class="section level3">
<h3>General context for the story</h3>
<p>It is the future. Zach, a rock musician and Alice, a geneticist, who have been together since high school live together in Elpis, the ‘City of Hope’.</p>
<p>Zach and Alice were born in the wake of the Reality Revolution which occurred after a Professor Milton Gray invented the Reality Prism – a transparent pyramid worn on the head – that brought honesty to the world. Propaganda and media spin became unsustainable, religions collapsed, advertising failed. Society could no longer be lied to. Everyone could know the truth about anything that they could look at. A gift, some said, to a previously self-interested, self-obsessed society in which the collective good had been eroded.</p>
<p>But also a curse. For, it soon became apparent that through this Reality Prism, people could no longer kid themselves about their own puffed-up selves as they could see what they were really like – by and large, pretty ordinary. And this caused mass depression. People lost faith in themselves. Artists abandoned their pursuits, believing they were untalented and worthless.</p>
<p>Zach and Alice have never worn a Reality Prism and have no concept of their limitations. They were born after the World Governance Agency (WGA) destroyed all Reality Prisms, along with many other pre-revolution technologies, with the aim of restoring community and well-being. However, this has not been straightforward and in this post-Prism world, society has split into pretty much two factions</p>
<ul>
<li>The Chippers who have had WiFi-enabled chips implanted into their brains, enabling them to record and broadcast what they see and think in real time; upload memories for future generations into a newly-created memoryBank and live-stream music and films directly into their brains.</li>
<li>The Clocktarians, followers of the old pre-Prism ways who use steam punk style technologies, who have elected not to have chips in their brains, regarded by the Chippers as backward-looking stuck in a ‘clockwork, Victorian society’.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone has a star, a limitless space on which to store their digital world.</p>
<p>Zach and Alice are Clocktarians. Their technology consists mainly of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Proteus, a device made from programmable matter that can transform shape and function simply by the owners’ wishes. Zach calls his a diePad, in the shape of a tombstone in an ironic reference to an over-reliance on technology at the expense of memory.</li>
<li>A Reality Checker, a clockwork mechanism that, at the point of critical velocity, projects an opaque human head that is linked to everything and can tell you anything. Every head has a personality and Zach’s is a handsome, laid back ‘dude’ who is like an electronic friend, who answers questions if he feels like it and often winds Zach up by giving him false information. And he often flirts with Alice.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-main-protagonists" class="section level3">
<h3>Main Protagonists</h3>
<ul>
<li>Zach
<ul>
<li>Rock musician in band called The Reality Enigma.</li>
<li>Spellbinding performer, has huge fan-base.</li>
<li>Only people living in Elpis get to see The Reality Enigma in the flesh. Otherwise all performances are done via an oculus riff, a multisensory headset for experiencing virtual gigs.</li>
<li>Zach’s music has influenced and changed thousands of lives.</li>
<li>Wishes he had lived pre-Revolutionary times, the turn of the 21st Century, a golden age for music when bands performed in reality at festivals.</li>
<li>Kind, gentle and self-doubting.</li>
<li>Believes science and maths are dull and uninspiring. Creates a problem between him and Alice as she thinks that because he isn’t interested in science, he isn’t interested in her. Leads to lots of misunderstandings between them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alice
<ul>
<li>Shy, lonely, academically-gifted – estranged from the social world until she met Zach in the college library.</li>
<li>Serious scientist, works at the Beimeni Centre of Genetics.</li>
<li>At 21, won the World Science Federation’s Einstein Medal for her genetics research</li>
<li>Desperately wants Zach to get over his fear of science so he can open his mind to the beauty of it.</li>

<div id="section-how-zachs-adventure-begins" class="section level3">
<h3>How Zach’s adventure begins</h3>
<p>Alice has been acting strangely, on edge for weeks, disconnected and uncommunicative, as if she is hiding something and Zach can’t get through to her. Arriving home from band practice, unusually, she already home and listening to an old album that the two of them enjoyed together, back in a simpler, less complicated time in their relationship. During an increasingly testy evening, that involves a discussion with the Head about whether or not a Proteus causes brain cancer, Alice is interrupted by an urgent call which she takes in private. She returns looking worried and is once again, distracted. She tells Zach that she has ‘a big decision to make’. Before going to bed, Zach asks her if he can help with the decision but she says he ‘already has’, thanking him for making ‘everything easier.’ He has no idea what she means and goes to sleep, uneasy.</p>
<p>On waking, Zach senses that something is wrong. And he is right. Alice has disappeared. Her clothes, her possessions and every photo of them together have gone. He can’t get hold of any of her family or friends as their contact information is stored on her Proteus, not on his diePad. He manages to contact the Beimeni Centre but is told that no one by the name of Alice Nightingale has ever worked there. He logs into their constellation but her star has gone. He calls her but finds that her number never existed. She has, thinks Zach, been ‘wiped from the planet.’ He summons The Head but he can’t find her either. He tells Zach that there are three possibilities: Alice has doesn’t want to be found, someone else doesn’t want her to be found or she never existed.</p>
<p>Zach calls his friend Nick, fellow band member and fan of the WGA-installed Repositories, vast underground repositories of actual film, books, art and music. Nick is a Chipper – solely for the purpose of promoting the band using memoryBank – and he puts the word out to their fans about Alice missing.</p>
<p>Thinking as hard as he can, Zach recalls the lyrics of the song she’d been playing the previous evening. Maybe they are significant? It may well be a farewell message and the Head is right. In searching for clues, he comes across a ‘memory stone’ which tells him to read what’s on there. File 1 is a research paper that Zach can’t fathom. It’s written in the ‘language of science’ and the Head offers to help Zach translate it and tells him that it looks like the results of her current work were ‘gonna blow the world’. Zach resolves to do ‘something sensible’ with the report.</p>
<p>Zach doesn’t want to believe that Alice has simply just left him. Rather, that someone has taken her and tried to erase her from the world. He decides to find her therapist, Dr Murali Genari and get Alice’s file. As he breaks into his office, Dr Genari comes up behind him and demands to know what he is doing. He is shaking but not with rage – with fear of Zach. Dr Genari turns out to be friendly and invites Zach to talk to him. Together they explore the possibilities of where Alice might have gone and the likelihood, rating her relationship satisfaction, that she has left him. During their discussion Zach is interrupted by a message on his diePad from someone called Milton. Zach is baffled as to who he is and how he knows that he is currently discussing reverse scoring. Out of the corner of his eye, he spots a ginger cat jumping down from the window ledge outside. The counsellor has to go but suggests that Zach and ‘his new friend Milton’ could try and work things out.</p>

<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>This tutorial uses the following packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>BayesFactor</code> <span class="citation">(Morey and Rouder 2014)</span> to compute Bayes factors</li>
<li><code>boot</code> <span class="citation">(Canty and Ripley 2017)</span> to compute bootstrap confidence intervals.</li>
<li><code>lm.beta</code> <span class="citation">(Behrendt 2014)</span> to compute standardized <em>b</em>-values</li>

<li><code>WRS2</code> <span class="citation">(Mair, Schoenbrodt, and Wilcox 2017)</span> to do various robust tests</li>
</ul>
<p>These packages are automatically loaded within this tutorial. If you are working outside of this tutorial (i.e. in <strong>RStudio</strong>) then you need to make sure that the package has been installed by executing <code>install.packages(&quot;package_name&quot;)</code>, where <em>package_name</em> is the name of the package. If the package is already installed, then you need to reference it in your current session by executing <code>library(package_name)</code>, where <em>package_name</em> is the name of the package.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>This tutorial has the data files pre-loaded so you shouldn’t need to do anything to access the data from within the tutorial. However, if you want to play around with what you have learnt in this tutorial outside of the tutorial environment (i.e. in a stand-alone <strong>RStudio</strong> session) you will need to download the data files and then read them into your <strong>R</strong> session. This tutorial uses the following file:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.discoveringstatistics.com/repository/ais_data/ais_16_memory_erasing.csv">ais_16_memory_erasing.csv</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can load the file in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming that you save this file into the working directory, you can load it by executing:
<ul>
<li><code>memory_dat &lt;- read_csv(&quot;ais_16_memory_erasing.csv&quot;)</code></li>
<li>If you save the file somewhere other than the working directory, you will need to specify the file location (see the tutorial called <em>adventr_02</em>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To load the file using a standard dialogue box to navigate your file system, execute:
<ul>
<li><code>memory_dat &lt;- read_csv(file.choose())</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can load the file direct from the URL (i.e., you don’t need to download it first) by executing:
<ul>
<li><code>memory_dat &lt;- read_csv(&quot;(http://www.discoveringstatistics.com/repository/ais_data/ais_16_memory_erasing.csv&quot;)</code></li>
<li>This method relies on an internet connection (and my server having not exploded!)</li>

<h2>Exploring the data</h2>
<div id="section-the-model" class="section level3">
<h3>The model</h3>
<p>During Zach’s visit to the JIG:SAW complex he visits several research buildings. In the second, he discovers experiments being conducted related to memory. In one experiment thirty-six participants with ID chips were tested. All participants met a stranger who had a 5-minute scripted conversation with them containing 10 critical pieces of information. A week later, the participants were asked to recall the encounter for 5 minutes, and then after a 10-minute break wrote everything that they could remember about the original encounter. During the 5-minute initial recall, one of three things happened: the control group (<em>N</em> = 12) received no intervention; the erase group (<em>N</em> = 12) had a pulse of electricity sent to their brain via their ID chip; and the replace group (<em>N</em> = 12) had conflicting verbal descriptions sent to their ID chip. The outcome was how many of the 10 critical pieces of information the participants wrote down after the recall phase. The prediction was that recall will be worse (i.e. lower scores) for participants who had an electrical pulse, or conflicting information sent to their ID chips during recall than those, in the control group, who experienced no interference. The data are in the tibble <code>memory_dat</code>, which has seven variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong>: Participant ID</li>
<li><strong>group</strong>: To which of the no intervention, memory erase or memory replace conditions the participant was assigned</li>
<li><strong>recall</strong>: How many of the 10 critical pieces of information the participant identified</li>
<li><strong>erase_dummy</strong>: Dummy variable that compares the erase condition to no intervention</li>
<li><strong>replace_dummy</strong>: Dummy variable that compares the replace condition to no intervention</li>
<li><strong>contrast_1</strong>: Variable that uses contrast codes to compare the memory conditions (combined) to no intervention</li>
<li><strong>contrast_2</strong>: Variable that uses contrast codes to compare the erase condition to the replace condition</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important variables are the first three - the others will be used to illustrate various things. Use the code box to inspect the tibble.</p>

<h2>Predictors with several categories</h2>
<div id="section-fitting-the-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Fitting the model</h3>
<p>It looks like recognition scores are, indeed lower in the replace condition compared to the control, but perhaps not the erase group (compared to the control). To fit the model we use the <code>lm()</code> function, because we are fitting a linear model with a categorical predictor. We’ve used this function before, just to recap it takes the following general form (I’ve retained only the key options):</p>
<p><code>lm(outcome ~ predictor(s), data, subset, na.action = na.fail)</code></p>
<p>Using what we’ve learnt in previous tutorials we could do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a model called <code>mem_mod</code> using <code>lm()</code></li>
<li>Add standardized betas using <code>lm.beta()</code> (Remember to execute <code>library(lm.beta)</code> first if trying this outside of the tutorial.)</li>
<li>Summarize the model using <code>summary()</code></li>
<li>Use <code>confint()</code> to get confidence intervals for the model parameters (the <em>b</em>s)</li>
<li>Plot diagnostics with <code>plot()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Using these hints, see whether you can fit the model in the code box below. (Another hint is you’re going to use the same code as in <em>adventr_15</em> but just changing the variable names and the name of the tibble.)</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="lm1" data-caption="Exercise" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="lm1-solution" data-caption="Exercise" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>mem_mod &lt;- lm(recall ~ group, data = memory_dat)

</div>
<p>The output provides estimates of the model parameters (the <em>b</em>-values) and the significance of these values. <strong>R</strong> automatically turns the variable <strong>group</strong> into dummy variables. It will order the categories alphabetically (so the order for our variable will be <em>Control</em>, <em>Erase</em>, <em>Replace</em>). It then creates dummy variables using the first category as the reference category (see Table 1). For our data dummy variable 1 will, therefore, represent the control group vs the erase group (which <strong>R</strong> has labelled as <strong>groupErase</strong>, which tells us that this is the variable <strong>group</strong> comparing the <em>Erase</em> group to the first category). Dummy variable 1 represents the control group vs the replace group (which <strong>R</strong> has labelled as <strong>groupReplace</strong>, which tells us that this is the variable <strong>group</strong> comparing the <em>Erase</em> group to the first category). For these data, these default comparisons make sense (we compare everything to the control group) but there will be times when the default creation of dummy variables and the alphabetical order of your groups do not combine to make the comparisons that you want. We’ll look at how to change this in due course.</p>
<table>

<p>For now, the <em>Y</em> intercept (<span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>) is 5, which is the value of recognition when when <strong>group</strong> is the reference category. As just described, <strong>R</strong> will have coded the variable <strong>group</strong> alphabetically (unless you tell it something different) so the reference category is the control group. So, (<span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>) is 5 because the mean of the control group is 5. As we saw above, the two predictors are dummy variables, and their respective <em>b</em>s reflect the differences between means that the dummy variables code. <strong>groupErase</strong> will be the difference between the mean of the erase group (4.75) and the mean of the control group (5.00), which is <span class="math inline">\(4.75 - 5.00 = -0.25\)</span>, and <strong>groupReplace</strong> will be the difference between the mean of the replace group (2.67) and the mean of the control group (5.00), which is <span class="math inline">\(2.67 - 5.00 = -2.33\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Just to illustrate what’s going on</h3>
<p>The tibble <code>memory_dat</code> contains two variables called <strong>erase_dummy</strong> and <strong>replace_dummy</strong> that contain the dummy codes that <strong>R</strong> has used. These variables are not used in the model, but are included to illustrate what <strong>R</strong> does when fitting a categorical predictor. It effectively creates variables like <strong>erase_dummy</strong> and <strong>replace_dummy</strong> that compare each group to the reference category (by default, the category with the first letter that is closest to the beginning of the alphabet). Try creating a model, called <code>dum_mod</code>, that predicts <strong>recall</strong> from <strong>erase_dummy</strong> and <strong>replace_dummy</strong>, and display a summary of the model. You should find that it is identical to the model that we just fitted using <strong>group</strong>. This example illustrates, then, how <strong>R</strong> takes a categorical variable and redefines it as a series of dummy coding variables.</p>

<h3>Assigning contrasts</h3>
<p>We can override the default dummy coding (or, as we shall see, use contrast coding) by using the <code>contrasts()</code> function. The way I like to use this function is to create variables containing the codes that I want to use, and then assign these variables to the variable that I want to add contrasts to by using these variables. This method is slightly long-winded but has the advantage that the variable names for the contrasts you create are used in the output. So, it enables you to set names for your contrasts, which make the output more interpretable.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that instead of comparing each group to the control, you wanted to compare each group to the replace group. The codes we would use to achieve this are in Table 2.</p>
<table>
<caption>Table 2: Dummy codes comparing each group to the replace group</caption>

<p>First, we need to create the two dummy variables that relate to columns 2 and 3 of the table. We’ll call the first <strong>rep_vs_control</strong> and the second <strong>rep_vs_erase</strong> because these names remind us of which groups are being compared by the dummy variable. We can create these variables by executing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rep_vs_control &lt;- c(1, 0, 0)
rep_vs_erase &lt;- c(0, 1, 0)</code></pre>
<p>We want to use these variables to set contrasts for the variable <strong>group</strong>. We can do this by executing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>contrasts(memory_dat$group) &lt;- cbind(rep_vs_control, rep_vs_erase)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s break this down:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>contrasts(memory_dat$group)</code> instructs <strong>R</strong> to set contrasts for the variable <strong>group</strong> in the tibble called <code>memory_dat</code>.</li>
<li><code>cbind(rep_vs_control, rep_vs_erase)</code> sets the contrast to be the two dummy variables we created bound together in columns (that’s what <code>cbind()</code> does). To get a flavour of what <code>cbind</code> is doing try executing only the right hand side of the command in the code box. You should see two columns that look like columns 2 and 3 of Table 2.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color='#009E73'>Hint: the contrast function only works on variables that are factors. The variable group in this tutorial has already been converted into a factor, but when you import data files remember to set variables that define groups as factors. There are various different ways to do this including the as_factor() function form the forcats package.</font></p>
<p>I don’t personally do this for the reason already explained, but if you don’t care about setting variable names for the dummy variables, you can set the contrasts in a single command that puts the codes directly into the <code>cbind()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>contrasts(memory_dat$group) &lt;- cbind(c(1, 0, 0), c(0, 1, 0))</code></pre>
<p>In the code box below set a contrast for the <strong>group</strong> variable that compares each group to the replace group as just described. Then re-fit the model predicting <strong>recall</strong> from <strong>group</strong>. Call the model <code>mem_mod_2</code> and don’t worry about requestioning standardized betas, confidence intervals or plots.</p>

mem_mod_2 &lt;- lm(recall ~ group, data = memory_dat)

</div>
<p>Compare the output with that of the previous model. Note that the overall fit of the model hasn’t changed <em>F</em>(2, 33) = 2.51, <em>p</em> = 0.097, but that the <em>b</em>-values have. (<span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>) is now 2.67, which is the mean of the replace group (because this is now the reference category). The first <em>b</em> for <strong>group</strong> is now the difference between the mean of the control group (5.00) and the mean of the replace group (2.67), which is <span class="math inline">\(5.00 - 2.67 = 2.33\)</span>, and the second <em>b</em> for <strong>group</strong> is now the difference between the mean of the erase group (4.75) and the mean of the replace group (2.67), which is <span class="math inline">\(4.75 - 2.67 = 2.08\)</span>. Finally, note that by naming our coding variables when we specified them, the output helpfully labels the <em>b</em>s for group with <em>rep_vs_control</em> and <em>rep_vs_erase</em>.</p>

<div id="section-contrast-coding" class="section level2">
<h2>Contrast coding</h2>
<p>In the chapter, lecture we was that we can use different types of coding to compare different groups. One alternative to dummy coding is contrast coding. We can achieve contrast coding in the same way as just described: using the <code>contrasts()</code> function. In the book, Zach discovered that the researchers at JIG:SAW had predicted that recall will be worse (i.e. lower scores) for participants who had an electrical pulse, or conflicting information sent to their ID chips during recall than those, in the control group, who experienced no interference. In the chapter/lecture we discovered that we could operationalize these hypotheses as two dummy variables using contrast codes.</p>
<table>
<caption>Table 3: Contrast codes for the memory data</caption>

<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Group</th>
<th align="right">Interference_vs_none</th>

</table>
<p>The first contrast (<strong>Interference_vs_none</strong> in Table 3) compares the control group to any group that had interference sent to their ID chips (i.e. the erase and replace groups combined), whereas the second (<strong>Erase_vs_replace</strong> in Table 3) ignores the control group (by coding it with 0) and compares the erase group to the replace group. These contrasts test these questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does having interference (but ignoring if the interference attempted to erase or replace the memory) sent to your ID chip result in different memory recall than having no interference?</li>
<li>Do attempts to replace memories lead to different recall than attempts to erase them?</li>
</ol>
<p>We can implement these contrasts in the same way as just described. All that we’ll be changing is the names of the contrasts and the codes that we use. See whether you can adapt your code from the previous code box, to set these two contrasts for the variable <strong>group</strong> and then create a model called <code>con_mod</code> (with standardized betas, confidence intervals and plots) that you then summarize.

<p>You should find that the <em>b</em> for the first contrast is proportional to the difference between the average of the erase and replace group (because the group sizes are equal we can take a straight average, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4.75 + 2.67}{2} = 3.71\)</span>) and the average of the control (5.00), which is <span class="math inline">\(5.00-3.71 = -1.29\)</span>.

<p><font color='#009E73'>Hint: if you’re doing this outside of the tutorial you need the sjstats package installed and you need to execute library(sjstats).</font></p>
<p>Remember that we place the model we created with <code>lm()</code> (in this case <code>mem_mod</code>) into the function <code>robust()</code>. For example, we could execute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>robust(mem_mod, conf.int = T)</code> to use the default “HC3” method and request 95% confidence intervals</li>
<li><code>robust(mem_mod, vcov = &quot;HC4&quot;, conf.int = T)</code> to use “HC4” and request 95% confidence intervals</li>

<h3>The WRS2 package</h3>
<p>The <code>WRS2</code> package <span class="citation">(Mair, Schoenbrodt, and Wilcox 2017)</span> wraps up a few of the many functions described by Wilcox to perform robust variants of tests <span class="citation">(Wilcox 2017)</span>. We’ll look at three functions that compare several means. They have a very similar format:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>t1way(formula, data = tibble, tr = 0.2, nboot = 100)</code>: is a test for trimmed means.</li>
<li><code>lincon(formula, data = tibble, tr = 0.2)</code>: <em>post hoc</em> tests for trimmed means</li>
<li><code>t1waybt(formula, data = tibble, tr = 0.2, nboot = 599)</code>: a variant of the test above that also uses a bootstrap</li>
<li><code>mcppb20(formula, data = tibble, tr = 0.2, nboot = 599)</code>: <em>post hoc</em> tests for the above test</li>
</ul>
<p>These functions have similar arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>formula</code>: the functions use a formula like that for <code>lm()</code>, so in this case we could use <code>recall ~ group</code>.</li>
<li><code>data = tibble</code>: replace tibble with the name of the tibble or data frame in which the data are stored (in this case <code>data = memory_dat</code>)</li>
<li><code>tr = 0.2</code>: determines the level of trim. The default is a 20% trim, which has been shown to perform well, but you could change this to 0.1 (10% trim) or any value up to 0.5 (although if you want to compare medians you should a function called <code>med1way()</code>). You can omit this argument if you’re happy with a 20% trim.</li>
<li><code>nboot = 599</code>: specifies the number of bootstrap samples. There is a case for increasing the defaults to 1000.</li>
</ul>

In this scenario we use the <code>anovaBF()</code> function. This function has basically the same format as most of the other functions in this tutorial:</p>
<p><code>object = anovaBF(formula = outcome ~ group_variable, data = tibble, whichModels = &quot;withmain&quot;, rscaleFixed = &quot;medium&quot;)</code></p>
<p>The function uses default priors that can be specified as a number or as “medium” (the default), “wide”, and “ultrawide”. These labels correspond to <em>r</em> scale values of 1/2, <span class="math inline">\(^\sqrt{2}/_2\)</span>, and 1. These priors are explained in <em>adventr_11</em> and also read <span class="citation">Rouder et al. (2012)</span>.</p>
<p>So we would use the same formula that we have used throughout, and specify our tibble as <code>memory_dat</code>. It’s a good idea to save this model into a new object (lets call it <code>mem_bf</code>) because you can do useful things with it (we didn’t do this for the <code>t1way()</code> functions, but you could).</p>
<p><font color='#009E73'>Tip: if you are using a tibble (rather than a data frame) then place the tibble’s name into the function data.frame(), to convert it to a data frame. This step is necessary because (at the time of writing) the BayesFactor package doesn’t accept tibbles.</font></p>
<p>For our data (using the default prior) we could execute:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mem_bf &lt;- anovaBF(formula = recall ~ group, data = data.frame(memory_dat))
mem_bf</code></pre>
<p>The first line creates the object <code>mem_bf</code> as described above and the second line prints it for us to see. Try this in the code box:</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="mem_bf" data-caption="Exercise" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-opts-chunk="1">{"fig.width":6.5,"fig.height":4,"fig.retina":2,"fig.align":"default","fig.keep":"high","fig.show":"asis","out.width":624,"warning":true,"error":false,"message":true,"exercise.df_print":"paged","exercise.checker":"NULL"}</script>
</div>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="mem_bf-solution" data-caption="Exercise" data-completion="1" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>mem_bf &lt;- anovaBF(formula = recall ~ group, data = data.frame(memory_dat))
mem_bf</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The value of 0.976 means that the probability of the data given the alternative hypothesis is 0.976 that given the null hypothesis. Put another way, you should shift your belief in the alternative hypothesis relative to the null by a factor of 0.976. There is basically equal evidence for the null and alternative hypothesis.</p>
